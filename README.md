#Repository Details

When my interest started moving towards security rather than development I didn't know where to start. This repository is for people like me who need guidance in the field of iOS security.
Most _guides_ tend to lean towards the following path structures.

1. Learn C / ARM Assembly (learn together).
2. Understand iOS internals.
3. Learn common exploit techniques and tools.
4. Read on how previous jailbreaks work and try to create one from scratch.
