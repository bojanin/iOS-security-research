# Repository Details

When my interest started moving towards security rather than development I didn't know where to start. This repository is for people like me who need guidance in the field of iOS security.
Most _guides_ tend to lean towards the following path structures.

1. Learn C / ARM Assembly (learn together).
2. Understand iOS internals.
3. Learn common exploit techniques and tools.
4. Read on how previous jailbreaks work and try to create one from scratch.

### Useful links

__Learning C__

* [If you have minor C experience, try this](http://buildyourownlisp.com)
* [How to write C in current years](https://matt.sh/howto-c)
* [The book I used to learn C.](http://icube-icps.unistra.fr/img_auth.php/d/db/ModernC.pdf)

  
My personal tip: Build something with C. Maybe start small and build a string reverser, then grow until you think you've learned enough to read other peoples code. If you are in university, take operating system courses and others that teach and/or use C/C++.

__Learning ARM__
* [The holy grail of learning ARM imo.](https://azeria-labs.com)
* [Arguably long but very rich tour of ARM.](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/asm.htm)
* [A Ray wenderlich tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2705-ios-assembly-tutorial-understanding-arm)
  * Ray wenderlich has some interesting and useful (althought a bit pricey) books on reverse engineering as well.
  
My personal tip: ___BUILD SOMETHING___ with ARM. Write a for loop and look at the underlying instructions, call functions and see how branching works, follow the azeria labs introduction until the end. If you are in university, take courses that teach assembly, most of which are taught by the computer engineering departments or EE.

## Final thoughts

This will get updated periodically once my knowledge increases and I become a more advanced researcher. If you are a true beginner, try to avoid the later useful links and start with C and ARM, and once you know you are proficient, start looking at the later links.

Also buy a test device, iPhone 4 or 4s is perfect for a 32bit device (which you can learn A LOT on) and you can buy them off eBay for < $75. Assuming you're reading this after 2018, you probably have a 64bit device (Anything after iPhone 5c).
